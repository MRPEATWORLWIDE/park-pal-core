# Demo Store `core` by Commerce Layer

Demo Store is a fully static e-commerce solution (with SSR capability) that uses Commerce Layer.

We have two repositories:

* **[`demo-store`](https://github.com/commercelayer/demo-store) GitHub template**.

    This template is using the `demo-store-core` as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).  
    You don't have to care about the whole source code, *you can focus on your data*. You'll have free updates with almost no risk just by running:

    ```sh
    git submodule update --remote
    ```

* **[`demo-store-core`](https://github.com/commercelayer/demo-store-core)** contains the source code.

  You just have to fork this repository and create your own, starting from here. This is also the way to contribute.  
  You can fully customize all aspects (behavior, UI, UX), but *you risk losing all future updates* if you start diverging too much.

## Getting started

Whether you want to go with the *template* or the *core* option, you should start by reading the [documentation](https://github.com/commercelayer/demo-store) located at `demo-store` repository.

If you want to contribute you can follow the [`demo-store-core` path](https://github.com/commercelayer/demo-store#getting-started).
